Hi, I’m **Saiful Alam Rakib** (Software Engineer).  
I'm expertise with `PHP`, `Laravel`, `JS`, `ReactJS`.

Currently I'm working as a **{{< param "employment.role" >}}** in **{{< param "employment.company" >}}**.

I'm working as a Developer since 2018.

This is my personal blogs.
As a personal blog, here I will write my personal opinion, personal thought, my suggestion, my advice to others etc.
I hope, I’ll write about my career, my tours & travels moments, my strategies etc.

As usually I use this(**MSAR**) as a short-form of my name, many of my friends and colleagues asked to me, what the thing is this(MSAR).
Let clearing the matter, **M**ohammad **S**aiful **A**lam **R**akib is my Full name and the first alphabet of each word in side by side make *MSAR* and that’s why I use this everywhere.
